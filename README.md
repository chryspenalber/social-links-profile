## Overview

This project is a simple and responsive **social links profile** component, allowing users to display their profile picture, name, location, and social media links in a visually appealing card. It was built using **HTML and CSS** with a focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and smooth hover effects.

## My Process

I followed a structured approach by first setting up semantic HTML elements and then applying CSS styles to ensure a clean and modern design. The use of CSS variables and flexbox helped maintain consistency and responsiveness.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Responsive design using `clamp()` and `flexbox`
- Google Fonts (Inter)

**Semantic HTML Tags Used:**

```html
<main>
<header>
<img>
<h1>
<h2>
<p>
<nav>
<ul>
<li>
<a>
<footer>
```

**CSS Features:**

- **CSS Variables:** Used to manage colors efficiently.
- **Responsive Design:** Applied `clamp()` for adaptable widths and font sizes.
- **Hover Effects:**
  - Background and text color transition on hover.
  - Smooth transition effects to improve user interaction.
- **Typography:**
  - Implemented "Inter" font from Google Fonts.
  - Applied font weights for better text hierarchy.
- **Flexbox & Box Model:**
  - Used `display: flex` for centering elements.
  - Applied `margin`, `padding`, and `border-radius` for spacing and smooth rounded corners.

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my understanding of:

- The importance of CSS variables for easy theme customization.
- Enhancing UI with hover states and smooth transitions.
- Using `clamp()` for adaptive design.
- Structuring HTML for accessibility and SEO.

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:

- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes.
- Experiment with more advanced animations using CSS.
- Add JavaScript for dynamic interactions (e.g., dark mode toggle).
